# Flask Python Exercise

Flask is a simple web framework that enables you to develop web applications with Python. The example provided here demonstrates how one can create a multi-path web application. The paths demonstrated in the example are
  - / : root endpoint where the application displays a "Hello World" text
  - /hello : an endpoint that displays the text "Hello AAU"
  - /viewht : an endpoint that displays an HTML page which will be rendered by a web browser

In order to run the example, first install Flask using the Python package manager; `pip`
```
  pip install Flask
```

Next, you can run the example with:
```
  python flask_demo.py 
```
